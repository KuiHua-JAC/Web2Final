# AutoFinder
Final project for our 3rd semester Web Development II class. The goal of this app is to provide users with a way of having a centralized ressource with all the cars, where everyone can post reviews about the cars they drive. 
In other words, it is a website designed for enthusiasts of all makes and brands to review their respective cars in one place, so users can easily compare and search for different models.

## Features
The website is both in French and english, but in order to change the language, it has to be done when logged in.
